jclouds binding to deltacloud requires a minimum server version of 0.1.0.

The identity and credential specified in jclouds will pass through deltacloud to 
the backend, such as gogrid.

To install deltacloud, do the following:
  * OS/X and jruby
    # use homebrew or equiv to install jruby
      * brew install jruby
        * note testing took place w/ 1.6.0
    # install and configure openssl to avoid "certificate verify failed" errors
      # install and link openssl
        * brew install openssl
        * brew link openssl
      # install jruby ssl
        * jruby -S gem install jruby-openssl
      # setup cert directory
        * mkdir $HOME/certs
        * curl -o $HOME/certs/cacert.pem http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem
      # rehash cert directory
        * export SSL_CERT_DIR=$HOME/certs
        * export SSL_CERT_FILE=$HOME/certs/cacert.pem
        * c_rehash
      # test
        * jruby -ropen-uri -e 'p open("https://encrypted.google.com")'
          * should see something like #<StringIO:0x5330cb4b>
    # install specific version of rack that doesn't conflict with deltacloud
      * jruby -S gem install rack --version 1.1.0
    # install net-ssh
      * jruby -S gem install net-ssh
    # install deltacloud core
      * jruby -S gem install deltacloud-core

To run a local deltacloud server, do the following:
  * jruby
    # export SSL_CERT_DIR=$HOME/certs
    # export SSL_CERT_FILE=$HOME/certs/cacert.pem
    # jruby -S deltacloudd -i mock 
      * or if you are running from a src tree: jruby -S ./server/bin/deltacloudd -i <driver>

Here are some notes about specific cloud providers
  * terremark
    # install fog gem
      * jruby -S gem install fog
  * rackspace
    # install cloudfiles, cloudservers gem
      * jruby -S gem install cloudservers
      * jruby -S gem install cloudfiles
  * ec2
    * using jruby --1.8, 'gem install aws' will fail with ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException per http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-5581 
    * using jruby --1.9, 'gem install aws' works, but running './server/bin/deltacloudd -i ec2' fails per http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-5529 
      # install i18n, aws gem
        * jruby -S gem install i18n
        * jruby -S gem install aws
