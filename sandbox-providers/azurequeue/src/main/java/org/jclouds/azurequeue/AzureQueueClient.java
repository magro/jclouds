/**
 * Provides access to Azure Queue via their REST API.
 * <p/>
 * The Queue service stores messages that may be read by any client who has access to the storage
 * identity.
 * <p/>
 * A queue can contain an unlimited number of messages, each of which can be up to 8 KB in size.
 * Messages are generally added to the end of the queue and retrieved from the front of the queue,
 * although first in, first out (FIFO) behavior is not guaranteed.
 * <p/>
 * If you need to store messages larger than 8 KB, you can store message data as a blob or in a
 * table, and then store a reference to the data as a message in a queue.
 * <p/>
 * All commands return a Future of the result from Azure Queue. Any exceptions incurred
 * during processing will be wrapped in an {@link ExecutionException} as documented in
 * {@link Future#get()}.
